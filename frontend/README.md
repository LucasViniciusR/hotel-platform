# Frontend (React)

This folder is for the **React frontend** of the Hotel Platform. I’m just starting, so it’s mostly empty for now.  

If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

## Getting Started

If you want to try things out:

```bash
# Go into the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Start a React app here (example)
npx create-react-app .

# Run the development server
npm start
