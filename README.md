# hotel-platform
This is a small open-source project I’m building to learn and share how a real-world hotel management backend could work.
It covers the basics like handling rooms, guests, and reservations, plus things like authentication, email notifications, and scheduled background tasks.

The idea is to keep it simple but structured. something that could be expanded later with a React frontend or extra modules.

# Planned Features

User authentication with roles (admin, staff, customer)

CRUD for rooms, guests, and reservations

I’ll keep improving it over time and make it as easy as possible for others to contribute or learn from.
